## ðŸš€ About the Project

The **Unified Line Segment Detection and Description (ULSD)** framework is a novel approach designed to simultaneously detect and describe line segments in images. This method integrates advanced deep learning techniques to achieve state-of-the-art performance in line segment detection and description tasks, making it highly applicable in fields such as computer vision, robotics, and multimedia analysis.

## ðŸ”œ Code Availability

The source code for this project will be made **open-source** on GitHub following the acceptance of the journal version of our conference paper. We are committed to sharing our work with the research community to foster further innovation and collaboration.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

Once the code is released, the repository will be organized as follows:
